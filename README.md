   - A barrel for mixing
   - Access to open storage for drying

2. **Create Sterilized Spore Paper:**

   - Wait approximately 18 hours for the sterilization process to complete

3. **Prepare the Paper:**

   - Wait approximately 8 hours until it becomes Prepared Spore Paper

4. **Collect Spores:**
   - Place all four mushroom samples on a Prepared Spore Paper
   - Wait approximately 12 hours for the mushrooms to release their spores
   - The paper will change appearance when it becomes fully Imprinted Spore Paper

5. **Create Spore Prints:**

   - This will yield 4 individual spore prints

### Growing Mushrooms

   - Exact recipes can be found in-game through the crafting menu

2. **Inoculate the Bags:**
   - Use a spore print to inoculate a Fruiting Bag
   - Place the inoculated bag in a suitable environment (details in-game)
